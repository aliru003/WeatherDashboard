Created a weather dashboard with form inputs for city search and that city is added to the search history
When I view current weather conditions for that city I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
When I view the UV index I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
When I view future weather conditions for that city I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
When I click on a city in the search history I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
